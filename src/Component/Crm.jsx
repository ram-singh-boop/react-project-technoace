       <div class="col-md-5 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-lg-5">
            <div role="header" class="addui-Accordion-header addui-Accordion-first addui-Accordion-open"><h4>Can you show me some ecommerce website designs developed by you?</h4></div>
            <div role="content" class="addui-Accordion-content addui-Accordion-first addui-Accordion-open" ><p>Our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vocso.com/portfolio/ecommerce">portfolio</a> includes all the ecommerce website designs which we have developed for our esteemed clients. We create intuitive designs by following the best UX practices. This is the start to establishing a global sales presence. These coveted online stores provide stellar shopping experiences with prime UX practices for shopping cart, product display, customer service, checkout process, etc.

Multiple ecommerce platforms, apps, and tools exist for creating your online purchasing experience, such as Magento, Shopify, or WooCommerce. Such  versatile online environments include various domains including managing orders, payment methods, shipping, fulfillment and marketing, to name but a few.
</p></div>
            
            <div role="header" class="addui-Accordion-header"><h4>How much time will it take in ecommerce website development?</h4></div>
            <div role="content" class="addui-Accordion-content" ><p>This depends on the desired user experience and technology stack used. We as one of the leading ecommerce development companies in india personalise projects to fulfil client needs. Content management systems (CMS) enable website owners to design, manage and edit material using internal resources. Customisation development time takes around 3 - 7 days. CMS engines such as Drupal, Shopify or WordPress reduce this timeframe and the associated cost as well. Custom marketplace development takes anywhere between 6 to 12 months: your requirements and budget are determining factors.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Don’t be misled by ‘average hours’ which may appear initially tempting to forecast spending, as this is often (under) estimated. Rather, various technologies, differing team scales and skill levels and developers deploying many techniques. Inducing further traffic, coding specifics and testing can also take even more time. We as an ecommerce design company take care of this.</p> 
<p>Sticking to the basics can focus on your deliverables without going overboard or exceeding your financials. Be adaptive and refrain from long term planning - set short term goals in real time instead. Negotiate with the development team for a month’s worth of work (for instance). Upon completion, an MVP must be produced, making it ready to launch and serve its purpose. Teams will add features monthly and enhance the product as per main requirements, such as end-users’ needs or performance. Subsequently, you’re able to formulate a productive project whilst relishing the results and planning the budget plus timescale too.</p>
            </div>
            <div role="header" class="addui-Accordion-header"><h4>Which eCommerce Platform should I choose to develop the websites?</h4></div>
            <div role="content" class="addui-Accordion-content" ><p>We offer a plethora of options, simplifying the development of interactive eCommerce websites. Top eCommerce website builders include Shopify, Prestashop, WooCommerce, BigCommerce which cater for online businesses.</p>
<p>This also depends on variables such as the commercial scaling plans, needs, budget and so on. We design our software using open-source platforms, personalised solutions, and SAAS based frameworks. Being a custom ecommerce web development company, we’ll always guide our clients accordingly to make the best informed decision.</p>
<p>Remember that whichever platform you opt for, it should fulfil your requirements and most certainly be mobile optimised, user ergonomic and easily upgradable at any point. Furthermore, ideally API integration compatibility, migration support and CMS incorporation should all be usable aspects, readily available at your disposal.</p>
            </div>
            <div role="header" class="addui-Accordion-header"><h4>Do you use templates to design my eCommerce store?</h4></div>
            <div role="content" class="addui-Accordion-content" ><p>Never, as we believe in originality and encourage autonomous selection of your desired design. We always personalise your work accordingly to ensure maximised output and efficiency. Reinforcing your distinctive creation will also make your brand more appealing to audiences who seek a functional yet innovative offering in today’s competitive world. This incorporates user experience, niche pathways, content development and of course, third party app integrations. Being a major ecommerce development solutions provider agency based in the USA, UAE, and India, we understand the USPs within the local and global markets to really drive traffic and engagement for that extra needed attention.</p></div>
            <div role="header" class="addui-Accordion-header"><h4>Is PHP good for eCommerce?</h4></div>
            <div role="content" class="addui-Accordion-content" ><p>PHP is a robust, gratis and convenient scripting language that offers e-commerce websites scalability for enterprise. Online sales continue to grow in both the retail and commercial sectors. Hence, with the CMS support and app integration compatibility, PHP (and Python) really do function well for businesses. It can also be cheaper to run, saving you money in the long run. Furthermore, speeds tend to be faster, have better analytics and documentation. We as a trusted <a target="_blank" href="/web-application-development">website application development company</a> ensure that you get the most out of your online stores and so recognise the significance of such coding foundations.</p></div>
            <div role="header" class="addui-Accordion-header"><h4>Does It Make Sense to Use Python to build an eCommerce website?</h4></div>
            <div role="content" class="addui-Accordion-content" ><p>Python is definitely ideal for ecommerce web development. Of the multiple frameworks available for this, Django is a prominent contender. Consider both vertical and horizontal scaling (the former being the main caching and database physical infrastructure). Ranging from scaling architecture to performance optimisation, Python spans all aspects. These include customisation, machine learning with AI (consisting of image plus speech recognition and fraud detection as well as translation). These recommendations assume that you’re not looking for preset templates or autonomous development, not to mention financial constraints.</p> 
</div>
            <div role="header" class="addui-Accordion-header"><h4>Will my eCommerce Website be secure?</h4></div>
            <div role="content" class="addui-Accordion-content" ><p>Every site we create and publish has SSL certificate encryption: an industry standard in website security. This enables data to be transferred via your website in a code which can’t be decrypted (even if intercepted or hacked). All material is developed with recent and updated PCI compliance standards. Still we advise to refrain from saving credit card details on your server or site database. It’s always better to deploy an external payment gateway, so your site can process payments without storing such sensitive information, which also limits your liability. The associated advantages are many.</p>
            </div>            
            <div role="header" class="addui-Accordion-header"><h4>What kind of services can I expect once I launch my website?</h4></div>
            <div role="content" class="addui-Accordion-content" ><p>Upon putting your site into the public domain, it’s important to run the following tests and checks (some of which are advisable even prior to doing so). As you go live, be mindful of performing. Here are our primary services that we can offer you after launching your ecommerce store:</p> 
            <ul>

            <br />
            <p>Specifically, we do the aforementioned on your behalf and create sitemap.xml and robots.txt files. The former helps Googlebot  crawlers to interpret your site structure and the URLs contained within it, whilst the latter focuses on (dis) allowed sections of the site. Analytics is another aspect to improve traffic flow to your site and webmaster tools ensure keyword searches, security and errors are all taken care of. We can also set up alerts or notifications from Google for any worthy mentions. This acts as a guide on your site’s behalf to see what works well for you. Monitoring your site’s speed and uptime are also worth doing too, as this helps you remain competitive within the online and digital market.  </p>
            
</div>
            <div role="header" class="addui-Accordion-header"><h4>Are there any recurring costs involved with owning a website?</h4></div>
            <div role="content" class="addui-Accordion-content" ><p>Yes, there are and these include maintenance, updates and hosting services (to name but a few). Domain registration, SSL encryption certificate subscription renewals, SEO and digital marketing are also part of this. Continual or revised design features to keep your website up to date is another facility to factor in, especially when subsidising cost overall. Combining these as a package often helps to unify the entire process and make it more economical (not to mention affordable in the long run).</p> 
</div>
            <div role="header" class="addui-Accordion-header"><h4>Can my store be hacked/ attacked by a virus?</h4></div>
            <div role="content" class="addui-Accordion-content" ><p>Unfortunately, many ecommerce sites are susceptible to such cyber attacks (although there are steps that can be undertaken to mitigate this). We reinforce your security by applying encrypted pathways to protect customer and transactional/financial data. Our regular audit services reveal weaknesses and serve to promptly fix them upon identification. This way, our esteemed customers can continue with running their business as usual, without having to concern themselves about an imminent threat.</p>

            <div role="header" class="addui-Accordion-header"><h4>What’s the difference between a template and a fully custom ecommerce site?</h4></div>
            <div role="content" class="addui-Accordion-content" ><p>The main differences between the two include:</p>
            <ul>
                    <li><strong>Budget:</strong> Templates are inherently cheaper than customisation</li>
                    <li><strong>Time:</strong> The same applies - templates are quicker to use and apply accordingly</li>
                    <li><strong>Brand:</strong> Customised material tends to outperform templates here</li>
                    <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Akin to branding, so custom wins here even for SEO too</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexibility and scalability:</strong> Custom based sites are more adaptive than templates</li>            
            </ul>
            <p>Nevertheless, templates are more reproducible than customised ones, as are the associated pathways with landing pages, for instance. Ultimately, templates are becoming more intuitive and smarter, courtesy of AI protocol plus machine learning.</p>
